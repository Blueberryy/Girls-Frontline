In Girls Frontline: Operation Binary each map is randomized with a randomized gamemode as well,
game modes include.

subscribed to it if you wish to play Girls Frontline: Operation Binary    


Here you can find the development discord for Girls Frontline: Operation Binary, where you can 
participate in any of the alpha testings, or request the server files to host on your own server.    

●More features will be added overtime 
●New gamemodes 
●Custom Loadouts 
●Skills and abilities, including perks.    

Be aware that this is just the content for the gamemode, and not infact the gamemode itself. 
Also note that for testing purposes your character model and weapon loadouts are randomized each 
respawn, any non-girl frontline models are currently placeholders and will be replaced with more, 
as we get more commissioned and added to the workshop.
